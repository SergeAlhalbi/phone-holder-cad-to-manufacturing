# Phone Holder CAD to Manufacturing
This project demonstrates the full pipeline of creating a phone holder from a hand-drawn image to CAD modeling and manufacturing, using MATLAB, SolidWorks, and CNC tools.

It includes:
- Image vectorization and conversion to DXF format using MATLAB
- SolidWorks part design based on DXF profiles
- Toolpath generation and G-code creation for CNC manufacturing
- Setup sheet documentation for the CNC process
